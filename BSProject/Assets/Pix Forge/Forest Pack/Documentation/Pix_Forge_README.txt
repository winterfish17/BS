Hello,

Thank you very much for purchasing the Forest Pack.

In order for your asset to work you gotta have the "2D-Extras" loaded in you project, It's an additional tool created by the community so we could have the amazing animated tiles 
and a lot of other features.

2D-Extras was not created bt Pix Forge, but don't worry, It's already in the pack you just bought, in any case, here's the link where you can find It online:

I hope the Forest Pack assets make your game even prettier, any doubt or suggestion can be emailed directly to the following address:

pixforge@gmail.com

Best Regards,

Gui Ramalho
